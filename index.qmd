# Overview and Findings of the Paper

-----------------

## Overview

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Social Networks (SN) matter for migration. SN $\approx$ Amenity.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  SNs are important for decision to **stay/leave** *and also* for **where exactly to go**.
:::

. . .

### This Paper

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Focuses on the **stay/leave** part, and a particular form of SN: relatives who assist with childcare.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2. Documents who relies more on this SN, and how migration decisions are impacted by its existence and extent.
:::

----------------

## Findings

::: {.fragment}
* Low-income HH are less mobile than high-income HH.
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Relatives provide 70% of childcare for low-income HH (50% for high-income).
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Presence of children in HH reduces cross-state mobility significantly.
:::

::: {.fragment }
* Income strongly predicts amount of childcare provided by market vs relatives.
:::

::: {.fragment }
* Correlation between mobility and reliance on family-provided childcare.

## Everybody is equally fertile

* Of course [I am totally biased](https://floswald.github.io/project/fertility/).

. . .

BUT

. . .

* I encourage you to precisely spell out the consequences of assuming exogenous fertility, and the precise assumptions you are making. In the data, people choose location and fertility **jointly**.

-----

## What is a Location?

* a tuple (wage, price of childcare type j, relative price of C) 
* all generated outside of the model - there is no mechanism in the model to set prices and wages.
* In the real world some places have very limited supply of market childcare - rural areas. Why not incorporate those constraints explicitly? 
* Locations differ starkly by housing costs for people with and without children - absent from the model. (My bias from above.)

## Calibration/Estimation

* Calibration of opportunity cost to (observed) mothers' wages: 
    **multi-way Selection problem?!** 
    1. Using observed wage for non-participants yields biased estimates (Heckman) 
    2. high wage mothers move to expensive city (Urban literature)
    3. might have lower fertility. (?)
    
. . .

* Effect of tenure: cost of childcare after 7 years of tenure might drop because...the kid is now 7+ years old!

---

## Counterfactuals and the Lucas Critique?

* The plan is to use the estimated model to perform different policies.

. . .

* The model is in partial equilibrium: all prices are estimated from data, there is no mechanism to set them inside the model.

. . .

* Policy will change allocation of people across space, presumably changing prices, how will we interpret the experiments?

# Suggestions

---------

## Suggestions

1. Focus more on the childcare story (starting in title?)
2. The choice of different childcare mixes adds a lot of complexity - try to make more out of this! Argue that we need this level of complexity (figure 6).
3. Maybe link somehow to gender-gap-location literature? You are providing a childcare choice model for work like [Le Barbanchon, Rathelot and Roulet - *Gender Differences in Job Search: Trading off Commute against Wage*](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/1/381/5928590)
